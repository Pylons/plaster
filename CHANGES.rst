0.4 (2017-03-30)
================

- Removed the ``plaster.NoSectionError`` exception. It's expected that
  individual loaders should return an empty dictionary of settings in the
  case that a section cannot be found.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/12

- Expect the ``wsgi`` protocol to raise ``LookupError`` exceptions when
  a named wsgi component cannot be found.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/12

0.3 (2017-03-27)
================

- Lookup now works differently. First "foo+bar" looks for an installed project
  distribution named "bar" with a loader named "foo". If this fails then it
  looks for any loader named "foo+bar".

- Rename the loader entry point to ``plaster.loader_factory``.

- Add the concept of protocols to ``plaster.get_loader`` and
  ``plaster.find_loaders``.

- ``plaster.find_loaders`` now works on just schemes and protocols
  instead of full ``PlasterURL`` objects and implements the lookup
  algorithm for finding loader factories.

- Change the ``ILoaderInfo`` interface to avoid being coupled to a
  particular uri. ``ILoaderInfo.load`` now takes a ``config_uri``
  parameter.

- Add a ``options`` dictionary to ``PlasterURL`` containing any arguments
  decoded from the query string. Loaders may use these for whatever they wish
  but one good option is default values in a config file.

- Define the ``IWSGIProtocol`` interface which addons can use to implement
  a loader that can return full wsgi apps, servers and filters.

- The scheme is now case-insensitive.

0.2 (2016-06-15)
================

- Allow ``config_uri`` syntax ``scheme:path`` alongside ``scheme://path``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/issues/3

- Improve errors to show the user-supplied values in the error message.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/4

- Add ``plaster.find_loaders`` which can be used by people who need a way
  to recover when ambiguous loaders are discovered via ``plaster.get_loader``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/5

- Rename ``plaster.Loader`` to ``plaster.ILoader`` to signify its purpose
  as an interface with no actual implementation.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/5

- Introduce ``plaster.ILoaderFactory`` to document what the entry point targets
  are expected to implement.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/plaster/pull/5

0.1 (2016-06-12)
================

- Initial release.
